        <h2> Los Angeles Lakers</h2>
        <p>
            The franchise began in 1946 as the Detroit Gems of the National Basketball League (NBL).[10] After one season, a new ownership relocated the team to Minneapolis, Minnesota,[10][11][12] and renamed the team as the Minneapolis Lakers.[13] The Lakers won the 1948 NBL championship before joining the rival Basketball Association of America, where they won the 1949 BAA championship. Following the merger of the NBL and the BAA into the NBA in 1949, the Lakers won four of the next five NBA championships.[14] After struggling financially in the late 1950s, they relocated to Los Angeles before the 1960–61 season.

        <h2>Franchise </h2>
        <p>
            The Lakers made the NBA Finals six times in the 1960s, but lost every series to the Celtics, beginning their long and storied rivalry. In 1968, the Lakers acquired four-time NBA Most Valuable Player (MVP) Wilt Chamberlain, and won their sixth NBA title in 1972, led by coach Bill Sharman. After the retirement of Chamberlain, the team traded for superstar Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. Two big changes came in 1979; first, Jerry Buss purchased the Lakers, and pioneered a vision of basketball as entertainment as well as sport.[15] Second, the Lakers drafted Magic Johnson first overall in the 1979 NBA draft. The combination of Johnson, a prodigy point guard, and dominant center in Abdul-Jabbar provided the Lakers with superstars to anchor their roster. The promotion of head coach Pat Riley in 1981 and addition of forward James Worthy through the 1982 draft established the Lakers as an NBA powerhouse throughout the 1980s. The franchise won five championships in a nine-year span, including two out of three marquee Finals matchups against the Celtics. The Lakers were defeated by their Boston archrivals in the 1984 Finals, but triumphed over them in 1985 and 1987.

        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>
            The franchise was founded in 1946 as the Detroit Gems and played in the National Basketball League (NBL) during the 1946–47 season where it finished last in the league with only 4 wins in 44 games. Though the team was scheduled to continue in the NBL the following season,[22] its ownership, faced with high losses due to low attendance and lack of homecourt, decided on selling the team to Ben Berger and Morris Chalfen of Minnesota for $15,000.[12][23]
            In 1948, the Lakers moved from the NBL to the Basketball Association of America (BAA), and Mikan's 28.3 point per game (ppg) scoring average set a BAA record. In the 1949 BAA Finals they won the championship, beating the Washington Capitols four games to two.[31] Following the season, the BAA and the NBL merged to form the National Basketball Association (NBA).[32] In the newly formed league, the Lakers improved their record to 51–17 and won their third straight professional championship.[33] In the 1950–51 season, Mikan won his third straight scoring title at 28.4 ppg and the Lakers went 44–24 to win their second straight division title.[34] One of those games, a 19–18 loss against the Fort Wayne Pistons, became infamous as the lowest scoring game in NBA history.[35] In the playoffs, they defeated the Indianapolis Olympians in three games but lost to the Rochester Royals in the next round.[29]
            In their last year in Minneapolis, the Lakers went 25–50. On January 18, 1960, the team was coming off a loss and traveling to St. Louis when their plane crash-landed.[48] Snow storms had driven the pilot 150 miles (240 km) off course when he was forced to land in a cornfield. No one was hurt.[49] Their record earned them the number two pick in the 1960 NBA draft. The team selected Jerry West from West Virginia University.[50] During the 1960 off-season, the Lakers became the NBA's first West Coast team when owner Bob Short decided to move the team to Los Angeles.[51] Led by Baylor's 34.8 ppg and 19.8 rpg, Los Angeles won 11 more than the year before in West's first season.[52] On November 15 that season, Baylor set a new NBA scoring record when he scored 71 points in a victory against the New York Knicks while grabbing 25 rebounds.[53] In doing so, Baylor broke his own NBA record of 64 points. Despite a losing record, the Lakers made the playoffs.[36] They came within two points of the NBA Finals when they lost in game seven of their second round series against St. Louis.[54]
